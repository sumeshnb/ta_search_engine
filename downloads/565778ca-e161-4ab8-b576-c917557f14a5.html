<p><h2>Upcoming Talks</strong></h2><br /><div style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC;"><p><strong>Designing Human-in-the-Loop Systems for Surgical  Training and Intervention</strong><br /> Friday, May 01, 2015<br /> 1:30pm - 3:00pm<br /> Ann Majewicz, PhD<br /> <i>University of Texas Dallas</i> <br /><p><a href="#" id="277-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide(277);return false;">Read More</a></p></p><div id="277" class="more"><p><a href="#" id="277-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide(277);return false;">Hide</a></p><p><b>Abstract: </b>Human-controlled robotic systems can greatly improve healthcare by synthesizing information, sharing knowledge with the human operator, and assisting with the delivery of care. This talk will highlight projects related to new technology for surgical simulation and training, as well as a more in depth discussion of a novel teleoperated robotic system that enables complex needle-based medical procedures, currently not possible. The central element to this work is understanding how to integrate the human with the physical system in an intuitive and natural way and how to leverage the relative strengths between the human and mechatronic system to improve outcomes.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Ann Majewicz completed B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at the University of St. Thomas, the M.S.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. Dr. Majewicz joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering as an Assistant Professor in August 2014, where she directs the Human-Enabled Robotic Technology Laboratory. She holds at courtesy appointment in the Department of Surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Her research interests focus on the interface between humans and robotic systems, with an emphasis on improving the delivery of surgical and interventional care, both for the patient and the provider.</p></div></div><p><h2>Past Talks</strong></h2><div style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC;"><p><strong>The Synaisthisi Project: Using Multi-Agent Systems  Technologies in Resource Allocation</strong><br /> Friday, April 10, 2015<br /> Ioannis A. Vetsikas, PhD<br /><i></i><br /><p><a href="#" id="274-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide(274);return false;">Read More</a></p></p><div id="274" class="more"><p><a href="#" id="274-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide(274);return false;">Hide</a></p><p><b>Abstract: </b>The proliferation of mobile smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) vision brings about a number of opportunities for new services and business models. Taking a cue from cloud computing, we develop the SYNAISTHISI platform. It promotes and enables the idea of ubiquitous sensing and intelligence. The actual purpose of the SYNAISTHISI project is to research and build a system that can seamlessly interface with heterogeneous components (devices or biological entities) that can offer sensing, processing and actuator capabilities and integrate them as reusable services that are managed and easily "weaved" into applications. The platform in essence constructs services from the "virtualized" components, and facilitates their exploitation in a systematic, scalable and potentially commercially viable manner.</p> <p>To implement this platform, a number of multi-agent systems technologies are crucial. First, to create complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) on-demand from available services, we develop agent strategies and mechanisms that facilitate the allocation of services to specific CPS. More specifically, the customers submit blueprints of CPS to be created together with a budget and their agent bids for possible services (offered by service providers) that maximize their customers' expected profit. A mechanism with desirable properties (e.g. efficient, fair) is developed that matches these services to customers, as well as strategies for the customer agents that allow them to deal with uncertainties, such as failing services or realizing at run time that more services might be necessary than those invoked initially.</p>  <p>Second, for one of the SYNAISHISI pilots, pertaining to the smart grid, our goal is to incentivize the usage of renewable energy and to flatten the demand from traditional power plants (coal etc). To achieve this, we develop multi-agent based technologies for Demand Reduction (DR) and Demand Side Management (DSM). Compared to existing DR/DSM technologies though our approach is not centralized, but rather each actor (e.g. household and end user) optimizes their energy usage individually. To coordinate the process we developed mechanisms (giving pricing or social incentives through the appropriate gamification), so that the optimal action for users and their agents is to shift and/or reduce their demand to coincide with times when energy is more abundant and available from renewable energy sources. The benefits of this approach are increased privacy, and also that no central system imposes a decision to the user, but rather the user desires herself to take the actions that are good for the overall system.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Ioannis A. Vetsikas holds a PhD from Cornell University, USA (2005) on the topic of designing trading agents in complex systems in the presence of tradeoffs. His research interests lie in the areas of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Multi-agent Systems and e-Commerce. He has published papers in the top conferences on AI and multi-agent systems. He has worked as senior researcher on the award-winning Aladdin project, which conducted research on intelligent autonomous agent and examined the properties of the resulting multi-agent systems. He is investigating applications of these techniques in a number of the areas, e.g. service procurement and electricity markets and optimization. His work draws upon decision and game theoretic optimization and examines both the design and development of agent strategies and algorithms, as well as the corresponding mechanisms that work in tandem with the strategies to achieve desired system-wide properties. He is actively involved in the trading agent community. His agents have won the International Trading Agent Competition (TAC) on several occasions. He served as general chair for TAC-10 and TAC-13 and is currently on the board of directors of the Association for Trading Agent Research.</p></div></div><div style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC;"><p><strong>Second talk Title: AMINESS: Analysis of Marine Information for Environmentally Safe Shipping</strong><br /> Friday, April 10, 2015<br /> Ioannis A. Vetsikas, PhD<br /><i></i><br /><p><a href="#" id="275-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide(275);return false;">Read More</a></p></p><div id="275" class="more"><p><a href="#" id="275-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide(275);return false;">Hide</a></p><p><b>Abstract: </b>The Aegean Sea represents an extreme example of marine safety risk waiting for a catastrophic event to happen. During the last few years the traffic of tankers from and to the Black Sea passing through its narrow straits has increased. Reducing the possibility of ship accidents in the Aegean Sea is important to all social, economic, environmental, and cultural sectors of Greece. And yet, there are no national level monitoring policies or pollution prevention and response mechanisms. Furthermore, legal limitations have made it hard so far to enforce shipping routes in the Aegean Sea, as numerous recently recorded IMO (International Marine Organization) violations testify. Even ships flying "flags of convenience" are allowed to formulate routes according to their best judgment, routes which in an area of especially high traffic intensity, very rarely follow a straight line. However, shipping companies and captains, in their shipping activities, may sometimes neglect financial risks that would derive from a possible accident, due to unsafe trajectories and local weather and sea conditions. These "stakeholders" would directly benefit from a monitoring system that may suggest optimal safe routes, while also delivering realtime alerts for their boats in case of an increased possibility of an accident. At the same time, such a monitoring system would serve as a valuable tool for policy development, by systematically recording and analyzing ship routes, meteorological and sea conditions, utilizing a direct connection to accident and near miss records.</p>  <p>Based on the above considerations, the goal of the AMINESS project is to promote shipping safety in the Aegean Sea though a web portal offering different levels of access to relevant stakeholders such as ship owners, policy makers, the scientific community and the general public. The portal will have three principle uses:</p>  <ul><li>To suggest both vessel and environmentally optimal safe route planning for ships.</li> <li>To produce alerts for ships in real time with respect to potential hazards associated to other ships, as a function of its location and planned route, its cargo and the meteorological/sea conditions.</li> <li>To support policy recommendations, through analysis of historical data in short and long term periods that correlate safety with ship trajectories.</li></ul>  <p>The project uses a range of historical and real-time spatiotemporal and marine data, including (a) information of vessel identity, position, speed and other relevant information such as ship cargo, e.g. from the AIS (Automatic Identification System), (b) online weather and sea forecasting data, such as wave magnitudes and wind directions and (c) geographical information indicating the position of sea, land and sea bed depth.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Ioannis A.

These OSNs have changed the way that users interact and offer attractive means of online social interactions and communications, but also raise privacy and security concerns.</p>  <p>In this talk, we investigate and analyze various security and privacy issues in the most popular online social network systems such as Facebook and Foursquare. More specifically, we talk about Identity Clone Attacks (ICAs), Friendship Identification and Inference (FII) attacks, and Venue Attacks. ICAs aim at creating fake identities for malicious purposes on OSNs. Such attacks severely affect the trust relationships a victim has built with other users if no active protection is applied. In an FII attack scenario, an adversary accumulates the initial attack relevant information based on the friend lists visible to him in a social network and utilizes this information to identify and infer a target's friends using a random walk based approach. In venue attacks, an attacker manipulate attributes related to venues to deceive users, compromise their privacy and destroy the reputation of the venues in an LBSN.</p>  <p>We first analyze and characterize behaviors of these attacks, formally define the attacks and present the attack steps, the attack algorithm and various attack schemes. We then study what makes such attacks successful and discuss potential defense approaches against these attacks. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Hassan Takabi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of North Texas. He is founder and director of the INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) Lab and affiliated with the Center for Information and Computer Security (CICS), which is designated as National Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research (CAE-R) and Education (CAE-IAE). His research is focused on various aspects of cybersecurity including privacy and security of online social networks, cloud computing security, advanced access control models, insider threats, usable security and privacy. He has authored or co-authored more than 30 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters in those areas. He is a member of IEEE and ACM.</p></div></div><div style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC;"><p><strong>Data Journalism Today:   Applications and Problems</strong><br /> Friday, March 27, 2015<br /> Jon McClure & Daniel Lathrop<br /><i>The Dallas Morning News</i><br /><p><a href="#" id="271-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide(271);return false;">Read More</a></p></p><div id="271" class="more"><p><a href="#" id="271-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide(271);return false;">Hide</a></p><p><b>Abstract: </b>Long before Nate Silver collected his first baseball card, journalists were exploiting technology, computation and advanced statistics to report the news. But with the advent of widespread electronic communication and record keeping, the open source software movement and the relocation of our core audience online, journalism's relationship with programming has changed. This talk will explore how journalism thrives in today's modern programming environment, and how newspapers are using code to bootstrap the news. </p>  <p>We will look at several examples of how The Dallas Morning News performs large and small scale data analyses, crafts engaging interactive content online and builds tools for the 21st century newsroom.</p>  <p>We will talk about how we participate in the open source community and how we hope to explore partnership opportunities with other programmers and academics for public service projects.</p>  <p>We will also talk about the kinds of problems we believe are on the near horizon as newsrooms lean down and must be smarter marshalling their investigative resources: problems like supplementing the shoe leather reporting model with intuition gained through machine learning applications. But we'll also talk about the practical problems we're immediately facing: a lack of simple journalistic productivity tools and limited resources to build them.</p><p><b>Biography: </b><br /><strong>Jon McClure</strong> is the News Applications Specialist with the Projects team at The Dallas Morning News. He is also a staff writer and contributes original reporting and investigations. Previously he was a database specialist at the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting and spent time at investigative magazine The Detail in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where his work appeared in the broadsheet the Irish Times and on BBC Radio Ulster.</p>   <p><strong>Daniel Lathrop</strong> is the Projects Data Editor at The Dallas Morning News.

Heterogeneity and transparent distribution are the focus of the SemaGrow project (http://semagrow.eu/), approached as federated querying that is transparently optimized and where semantic transformations are dynamically applied.

Being an important element of human communication, its use is very frequent in texts, as a means to convey meaning to the reader. Locating and identifying arguments may provide valuable help in identifying the various discussion issues, in following on how the discussion has evolved and what the discussion outcome might have been. This process is an aspect of the research field known as computational argumentation, which apart from identifying arguments, also studies the process of reasoning with arguments, and the process of the argumentation among computational agents. This talk focuses on argument mining, the process of identifying arguments in documents. It will provide an overview on argumentation, the structure of arguments, the state-of-art in argument mining from various types of documents, along with recent advances towards argument mining from the social web.

This architecture enables the safe use of high-performance, untrusted, and complex control algorithms without requiring them to be formally verified. Simplex incorporates a supervisory controller and safety controller that will take over control if the unverified logic misbehaves. The supervisory controller should (1) guarantee the system never enters and unsafe state (safety), but (2) use the complex controller as much as possible (minimize conservatism).  <br /><br />The problem of precisely and correctly defining this switching logic has previously been considered either using a control-theoretic optimization approach, or through an offline hybrid systems reachability computation. In this work, we prove that a combined online/offline approach, which uses aspects of the two earlier methods along with a real-time reachability computation, also maintains safety, but with significantly less conservatism. We demonstrate the advantages of this unified approach on a saturated inverted pendulum system, where the usable region of attraction is 227% larger than the earlier approach. </p><p><b>Biography: </b>Stanley Bak received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2007 (summa cum laude), and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2009.

High Performance Computing (HPC) systems today can see computational errors at rates of once a week to once every 4-5 hours. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), for example, L1 cache soft errors occurred about once every five hours on the 104K node BlueGene/L system. As the number of devices per system scales into the millions, errors will become even more pervasive. In fact, a recent DARPA study on exa- scale computing found that evolutionary extensions of today's HPC systems (CrayXT, BlueGene) will be unable to reach exaFLOP performance by 2020 within a power budget of 20MW, the typical limit of modern computing centers. For these systems, the study observes that "traditional resiliency solutions will not be sufficient". To make matters worse, emerging computing systems (e.g. mobile and HPC) are becoming increasingly power constrained. Traditional hardware/software approaches are likely to be impractical for these power constrained systems due to their heavy reliance on redundant, worst-case, and conservative designs. Instead, we investigate how we can leverage inherent application and algorithm characteristics (e.g. natural error resilience, spatial and temporal reuse, and fault containment) to build more efficient robust systems. In this talk, I will describe algorithmic and architectural approaches that leverage application and algorithm-awareness for building such systems. These approaches include a) a numerical optimization-based methodology for converting applications into a more error tolerant form b) application-specific techniques for low-overhead fault detection and correction, and c) hardware support to leverage application-level error resilience. Our studies show that application and algorithm-awareness can significantly increase the robustness of computing systems, while also reducing the cost of meeting reliability targets.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Joseph Callenes-Sloan received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering and a B.S. degree in computer engineering from Iowa State University in 2007, and a M.S. and Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

However, physiological signals always have a great intra- and inter-individual variability, and are often nonstationary, irregular, chaotic, and noisy. It is challenging to handle massive sensory data streams and extracting useful information to achieve personalized decision-making. This talk will present two personalized online monitoring and medical decision-making frameworks: pattern-based approach and regression-based approach. Specifically, a new algorithm was developed to model nonstationary time series streams, and a new adaptive pattern-learning framework was proposed to discover personalized predictive physiological patterns that associated with a specific event or state. The pattern-based adaptive learning approach have been successfully applied to solve three challenging real-world problems including online prediction of seizure onset for patients with epilepsy, online prediction of cognitive-distraction for drivers in unfamiliar environments, and cognitive workload identification using multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

Although recent motorized prostheses have the potential to restore mobility in this impaired  population, critical barriers in control technology still limit their clinical viability. These systems discretize the gait  cycle into multiple distinct control models, each tracking reference joint torques, kinematics (angles/velocities), or  impedances (stiffness/viscosity) that resemble human behavior. These increasingly complex designs are difficult  to tune to individuals and generalize to different tasks, and their sequential controllers are not necessarily robust  to external perturbations that push joint kinematics forward or backward in the gait cycle. However, recent bipedal  robots can stably walk, run, and climb stairs with a single control model based on virtual constraints, which drive  joint patterns as functions of a mechanical variable that continuously represents the robot?s progression through  the gait cycle, i.e., a sense of &quot;phase.&quot;    These breakthroughs in robot control theory present an emerging opportunity to address a key roadblock in  prosthetic and orthotic control technology, which will be the topic of this talk.

In a rapidly changing field like computing, this can lead to frequent job changes, burnout and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, today we hear a lot about outsourcing and some wonder whether there will be computing careers in the future. This talk is based on the premise that the jobs will certainly change over time but there will be computing careers for a long time. Dr. Frailey shows how to prepare for a life-long career in computing, covering such topics as where the opportunities are, what it?s like to work in the computing field in a large, professionally run computing organization, how the field of computing has changed over the years, how it is likely to change in the future, and what hasn?t changed. The talk also addresses what employers look for when hiring people in the computing field and what it takes to have a successful career.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dennis is a recently retired Principal Fellow at Raytheon Company in Plano, Texas.

In this talk, we focus on the problem of optimally affecting the outcome of dissemination by manipulating the underlying graph structure. We aim to answer two questions: (1) what are the key graph parameters for the so-called tipping point? and (2) how can we design effective algorithms to optimize such parameters in a desired way? We show that for a large family of dissemination models, the problem becomes optimizing the leading eigen-value of an appropriately defined system matrix associated with the underlying graph. We then present two algorithms as the instantiations of such an optimization problem - one to minimize the leading eigen-value (e.g., stopping virus propagation) and the other to maximize the eigen-value (e.g., promoting product adoption).

High quality features are of vital importance to building successful predictive models. However, the features extracted directly from EMRs are typically noisy, heterogeneous and very sparse.

With the  addition of touch or force feedback sensors to a 3DTI environment, new avenues are being explored for a Tele- rehabilitation system in an augmented virtual reality environment. In the past few years, advances have been  made in various technologies such as 3D cameras, body sensor networks, and high precision haptic devices.  These sensors along with powerful processing and communication capabilities have led to a very immersive  experience for users of such systems. In this paper we describe such a system with Microsoft Kinect cameras and  haptic devices in a Tele-rehabilitation setup.

The machine has hardware support for 128 threads per processor, a flat shared memory without locality, and individually lockable 64-bit words. Currently, the largest machine available has 128 processors and 4 Terabytes of shared memory. It is thus very suitable for implementation of graph algorithms that require &quot;unstructured&quot; access to a large memory space. I will describe my experiences with implementing algorithms on this architecture. Examples include DNA sequencing (using de Bruijn graphs), influenza virus evolution (shortest trees) and image segmentation (maxflow-mincut). In each case I will show that there are no issues of problem partitioning or load balancing and that good performance can be obtained using ordinary C code with the addition of a few pragmas and machine intrinsics.  The end result is that the user sees a familiar C/C++ programming environment into which the implementation details of parallelism intrude very occasionally, if at all. The XMT thus permits the programmer to be highly productive without having to be concerned with arcane details of the parallel architecture. The ease of programming of the XMT has lessons for the current crop of commodity multicore/multiGPU systems.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr Shahid Bokhari received the BSc degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Engineering &amp; Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan, in 1974 and the MS and PhD degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1976 and 1978.

In this talk, I will describe two systems -? Pisces and Persea -? that we have designed to take advantage of the information that is inherent in the social network structure. Pisces is a system for enhancing anonymity in peer-?to-?peer (P2P) anonymity system designs. An anonymity system, such as the popular Tor network, helps protect your privacy on the Internet and enables people in countries like Syria to get around Internet censorship. In Pisces, we route our anonymity paths through users&#039; social connections using verifiable random paths. We show that this technique provides much better privacy than prior designs in the face of strong attackers. <br />Persea addresses the reliability of looking up information and resources in a P2P system, such as Skype or Bittorrent. Existing systems are vulnerable to an attacker adding many malicious peer nodes, e.g. by using a botnet, and having them undermine the reliability of lookups. We propose a P2P system, Persea, based on a bootstrap tree -- essentially a social network that shows how each person entered the P2P system via a series of invitations. We embed the bootstrap tree into the identities that nodes use to locate themselves and perform lookups. We argue that this approach is more suitable to P2P systems than prior approaches and show that it provides lookup success rates at least as good as in prior work.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Matthew Wright is an associate professor at the University of Texas at Arlington.

The goal of the talk is not to do an exhaustive survey of NoSQL systems. The aim is to do a broad brush analysis of what these developments mean - the good and the bad aspects! Based on my more than three decades of database systems work in the research and product arenas, I will outline what are many of the pitfalls to avoid since there is currently a mad rush to develop and adopt a plethora of NoSQL systems in a segment of the IT population, including the research community. In rushing to develop these systems to overcome some of the shortcomings of the relational systems, many good principles of the latter, which go beyond the relational model and the SQL language, have been left by the wayside. Now many of the features that were initially discarded as unnecessary in the NoSQL systems are being brought in, but unfortunately in ad hoc ways. Hopefully, the lessons learnt over three decades with relational and other systems would not go to waste and we wouldn?t let history repeat itself with respect to simple minded approaches leading to enormous pain later on for developers as well as users of the NoSQL systems!

A homomorphic encryption system allows one to perform the computations on encrypted data thus enabling delegations of computations to a untrusted entity without the loss of privacy. The recent paradigm of cloud computing, which aggregates the computing, storage and network resources, makes such an encryption system all the more necessary to preserve privacy on the cloud. Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos introduced this notion and recently Gentry proposed a homomorphic encryption system. While Gentry&#039;s scheme is semantically secure but it is not practical.

New sequencing technology for expressed RNA (RNA-Seq), or whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, has improved expression profiling. The key advantage of RNA-Seq is that it provides a more comprehensive view of the transcriptome with a single experiment than microarrays, including the ability to detect splice variants, splice junctions, and completely novel transcripts. Sequencing of all the coding regions in the genome (Exome) or targeted exome capture is considered a cost-effective alternative to complete whole genome sequencing and is becoming an effective strategy to identify genetic variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (INDELs), and large structure variations (SVs) in genetic disease research. In this talk, I will present several novel NGS bioinformatics analysis algorithms/pipelines that we have developed recently.<br /> <br />The first algorithm that we developed was termed &quot;Read Split Walk&quot; (RSW) to identify non-canonical splicing regions using RNA-Seq data and applied it to ER stress-induced Ire1&amp;#945; heterozygote and knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines with the aim of identifying additional IRE1&amp;#945; targets. Proof of principle came in our results by the fact that the 26bp non-conventional splice site in Xbp1 was detected as the top hit by our RSW pipeline in heterozygote samples from both treatment cases but never in the negative control Ire1&amp;#945; knock-out samples. We have compared the Xbp1 results from our approach with results using the alignment program Exonerate and the Unix ?grep? command.  We conclude that our RSW pipeline is practical and complete in identifying novel splice junction sites on a genome-wide level. We believe our pipeline can detect novel spliced sites in RNA-Seq data generated under similar conditions for other species.<br /> <br />Many NGS analysis tools focusing on read alignment and variant calling functions for exome sequencing data have been developed in recent years. However, publicly available tools dealing with the downstream analysis of genome-wide variants are fewer and have limited functionality. To fulfill this goal we developed SNPAAMapper, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant analysis pipeline that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. exon, intron, etc.), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation, etc.), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus 5?UTR, etc.). In addition, we have also developed a pipeline that can accurately discover structure variations (SVs) in individual whole genome sequences using the strengths of existing approaches/methods.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Yongsheng Bai received his Ph.D. in Quantitative Biology from The University of Texas at Arlington in 2007.

Indeed, the SIMPLEX algorithm developed in the 1940&#039;s by George Dantzig to solve linear programs was termed the algorithm that runs the world in a recent article partially available at http://www.cccblog.org/2012/08/20/the-algorithm-that-runs-the-world/. The crux of this article was that the simplex method cannot solve sufficiently fast the increasingly larger problems of today&#039;s high-speed, high-tech, ever-accelerating world where near real-time solutions are sought.<br /><br />In this seminar, a newly patented solution approach called Constraint Optimal Selection Techniques, or COSTs, is described to reduce dramatically the number of calculations needed to solve large-scale linear programs with huge numbers of variables and constraints. The essential idea is that only a relatively few constraints of a linear programming problem determine the answer. Using various constraint selection metrics, COSTs determine the constraints most likely to do so before beginning the solution.

The work is in part motivated by the extreme inadequacy of existing ad hoc WLAN protocols to support streaming traffic. We introduce a distributed cross-layer scheduling algorithm for networks with single-hop transmissions that guarantees finite buffer sizes and meet minimum utility requirements (e.g. throughput guarantees). The proposed algorithm achieves a total utility arbitrarily close to the optimal value with a tradeoff in the buffer sizes. The finite buffer property is not only important from an implementation perspective, but, along with the algorithm, also yields superior delay performance. The algorithm also results in upper-bounds on the average delay that scales inversely with the buffer size. Unlike traditional back-pressure-based optimal algorithms, our proposed algorithm does not need centralized computation and achieves fully local implementation without global message passing. Rigorous numerical and implementation results are presented to illustrate the close-to-optimal throughput and far better delay performance compared to other recent distributed algorithms.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Eylen Ekici has received his BS and MS degrees in Computer Engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1997 and 1998, respectively.

Indeed, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to six people for their research in game theory. The first was awarded to John Nash, et al, in 1992, after which he became the subject of the movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.  Numerous computer scientists now work in this area - on computational algorithms, multi-agent systems, artificial intelligence, and applications to such fields such as computer system scheduling, etc. But still the Nash Equilibrium (NE) is the standard solution concept underlying n-person game theory. In an NE, rationality is interpreted as selfishness. But actual competitive interactions often give results differing from this assumption.<br /><br />In this seminar, two new alternative approaches are introduced.  After a brief introduction to game theory, the notion of a Disappointment Equilibrium (DE) is defined as a solution concept in which a mutual standoff forces cooperation that yields better outcomes for all players in many situations. Examples include the famous Prisoner?s Dilemma game and other important social interactions. The Compromise Equilibrium (CE) is next defined as an example of the new Scalar Equilibrium (SE) concept, which can be defined for any competitive situation. In particular, the CE gives cooperative results similar to the DE. However, SEs are computationally tractable, whereas both NEs and DEs become increasingly difficult to compute for n > 2. Finally, in summary, the implications of the new DE and SE to game theory and other fields are discussed.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Bill Corley of the IMSE Department and COSMOS research center has a B.S. in electrical engineering and an M.S. in information science from Georgia Tech, a Ph.D. in systems engineering from the University of Florida, and a Ph.D. in mathematics form UT Arlington.

The main reason is that the radio transmission consumes energy approximately three times comparing to other operations. Thus, techniques such as data aggregation have been widely used in WSN to preserve energy. Despite its appealing and powerful features, data aggregation requires a high level of security as tampering with aggregating data can be suspected due to small bit errors. We propose a comprehensive trust management approach deal with the potential dishonest and faulty motes in sensor networks. Unlike other trust management approaches, we take into account multiple properties in leveraging between positive trust and behavior uncertainty so as to yield the projection of trust which represents truster?s confidence in the trustee node to have the capability to complete the task. We comprehensively evaluate and compare trust management schemes in the sensing environment using TOSSim simulator. The results have shown the proposed scheme is memory efficient and provides fairly accurate results allowing sensors to appropriately adjust themselves and manage to carry out their missions during normal and extreme environment.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Kumar Madria received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India in 1995.

Instead of being isolated as in traditional classification problems, protein functions are highly correlated, which provides a new opportunity to improve the overall prediction accuracy by exploiting the function-function correlations. To achieve this, we place protein function prediction under the framework of multi-label classification, an emerging topic in machine learning in recent years, to learn the class memberships of each protein with respect to all the biological functional categories in an integral process, such that the function-function correlations can be elegantly incorporated into a variety of learning models.<br /><br />Anticipating an organism&#039;s phenotypes based on the molecules encoded by its genome is critical for the diagnosis and intervention of major human diseases. Imaging genetics is a powerful tool to integrate phenotypes and genotypes, which is able to characterize neurodegenerative process in the progression of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders by utilizing multi-modal brain imaging and genome-wide array data. Different to traditional association studies that identify genetic and imaging biomarkers by performing univariate regression analysis, we propose novel structured sparse learning algorithms to associate genetic and imaging biomarkers to both disease progression status and symptoms, where we consider biomarkers, cognitive measures, and disease status as an integral learning target to explore the interrelated structures within and between both genetic/imaging data and clinical data, and incorporate the biological knowledge among genetic biomarkers induced from their genetic arrangement.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Hua Wang is a PhD candidate under the supervision of Dr. Heng Huang and Dr. Chris Ding in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Texas at Arlington.

Subspace learning is useful for dimensionality reduction and classification, and attracted great interests of many researchers due to the simplicity and effectiveness of these algorithms. Most subspace learning algorithms can be viewed as a special case in a general graph embedding framework associated with a trace ratio optimization problem. Directly solving the trace ratio problem is difficult, traditional method usually solve an approximate problem, i.e., the ratio trace problem, which has closed form solution. In our work, we proposed an iterative method to solve the trace ratio problem directly. We proved that the iterative method will converge to the global optimum, and the convergence rate is quadratic, thus is very fast. Experimental results show that, in most cases, the performance of solving the trace ratio problem is better than those of solving the ratio trace problem. We also applied the trace ratio criterion for feature selection. Instead of the brute force search, we proposed an efficient method to find the feature subset with the globally optimal trace ratio value.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Feiping Nie received the Ph.D. degree in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Retrieving<br />similar patterns is a necessary component of many practical<br />applications in computer vision and pattern recognition.

In this work, we present a hierarchical discovery protocol for WSNs with MEs, namely Dual Beacon Discovery (2BD) protocol, based on two different Beacon messages emitted by the mobile node (i.e., Long-Range Beacons and Short-Range Beacons), and its analytical model, based on Discrete-time Markov Chains. Then, we perform a parameter optimization study in order to achieve a minimum energy consumption by the static sensor, with respect to specific QoS bounds. Finally, we perform a complete performance analysis of our protocol, in terms of energy spent for ME contact.

In recent times there has been a considerable interest in the energy efficient design of networks, protocols, and systems. However, most of the current approaches aim to reduce the device energy (battery) consumption but not necessarily ensure the completion of user activities within specified energy constraints. For example, a user may want to download a file from the network; can he complete the download before exhausting the battery of his wireless device? Existing energy conservation approaches make a best effort towards achieving this goal.<br /><br />In this talk we will discuss the emerging field of energy adaptive computing taking user&#039;s available energy into consideration.

The prime sources of this bottleneck are the performance gap between the processor and disk storage and the large memory requirements of ever-hungry applications. Although advanced memory hierarchies and parallel file systems have been developed in recent years, they only provide high bandwidth for contiguous, well-formed data streams, performing poorly in serving small and noncontiguous data requests. Unfortunately, many HPC applications make a large number of requests for small and noncontiguous pieces of data, as do high-level I/O libraries such as HDF-5. The problematic data-access wall remains after years of study and, in fact, is becoming probably the most notorious bottleneck of HPC. We propose a new dynamic application-specific I/O architecture for HPC. Unlike traditional I/O designs where data is stored and retrieved by request, our architecture is based on a novel Server-Push model in which a data access server proactively pushes data from a file server to the memory and makes smart decision on data layout based on the data access pattern of the underlying application. Here dynamic means that the data layout and prefetching mechanisms can be changed dynamically between applications and even within one application. In this talk, we present the design consideration and implementation results under MPICH2 and PVFS of the dynamic application-specific approach. We also discuss the possible hardware support to extend the server-push architecture to cache and memory data access.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Xian-He Sun is the chairman and a professor of the Department of Computer Science, the director of the Scalable Computing Software laboratory at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and a guest faculty in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at the Argonne National Laboratory.

To date, most of those community detection techniques can be used only if the entire graph is available for discovering communities. Such strong limitation makes it feasible for only an online social site owner to conduct community detection, as others are not able to view the full picture of the web 2.0 based online social networks. In this paper, we will mainly address how to leverage the knowledge locally available on the online social networks (OSNs), the list of friends on individuals web page for example, to detect minimum community. We will see even such local knowledge is not without a cost. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently detect the minimum community including a group of targeted users on OSNs with minimum cost. In fact, even if the entire OSN graph is given, the minimum community detection problem is NP-hard, let alone the local-view based detection. Since our algorithm is particularly based on topology properties of social networks, it shows pretty good performance in our experiments over real-world social network data sets.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Ms. Na Li is a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington and a research assistant in the Center for Research in Wireless Mobility and Networking (CReWMaN).

It is an understatement to say that the performance of multicore systems is limited by their memory systems performance. Our research has developed both hardware and software solutions to improve the performance of (L1 and L2) cache memories. Software solutions include profiling of data access patterns, relocating data, and restructuring code to improve performance. Hardware solutions include customizing cache address mapping (or indexing) for different threads and/or different objects within an application, and the simultaneous existence of multiple address mappings.<br /><br />We are developing a program analysis tool that helps with our hardware and software solutions. Gleipnir is built on top of a widely used program analysis tool called Valgrind. When fully developed, Gleipnir can be used to obtain very fine grained information with each memory access, including the program variable associated with that access, the function and thread that caused the access.<br /><br />Localities exhibited by data depend on object types and how they are accessed in an application. Better performance can be achieved by spreading data accessed by applications more uniformly across the cache and minimize cache conflicts. Code and data restructuring techniques that rely on profiled information on data accesses can minimize conflict misses and improve uniformity of cache accesses.<br /><br />Uniformity of accesses can also be achieved using custom indexing for each application. We are also investigating the use of multiple indexing schemes (or multiple decoders) with cache memories. Performance can also be improved if cache memories are partitioned and reconfigured optimally to meet divergent needs of data types and access patterns. Combining data and code restructuring with reconfigurable caches can lead to even better performance.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Krishna Kavi is currently a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and the Director of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Net-Centric Software and Systems at the University of North Texas.

Most of the approaches targeted to WSNs with mobile sinks (MSs) addressed the problem of data dissemination where only a few messages are reported during a long timeframe. However, dissemination of streaming data is becoming relevant in WSNs, as more and more multimedia sensor nodes  equipped with image, audio, and video capabilities  are being used to characterize the sensing environment. In this scenario, a sequence of messages propagates into the network, hence the problem of finding an effective routing path for disseminating data to MSs becomes even more challenging, since the communication overhead for reaching the MS might also be significant.<br /><br />In this talk, we present an energy-efficient streaming data dissemination (SDD) protocol for cluster-based WSNs with MSs. For the energy efficient on-demand route discovery, we design a heuristic broadcasting over Cluster Heads protocol for multihop cluster-based WSNs, where a direct link between CHs is not necessarily available. By introducing a cross-clusters handover mechanism and a path redirection scheme, SDD maintains the end-to-end connectivity between the source and the MS, while avoiding the constant transmission of the MS location as it moves across multiple clusters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed SDD protocol, and compare it with a hierarchical cluster-based data dissemination protocol. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness, in terms of both end-to-end delivery delay and energy-efficiency.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Mr. Long Cheng is a PhD student in the State Key Lab of Network and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications since August 2007.

Meanwhile, research on inference (estimation) in graphical models is flourishing in the computer science community. These two thrusts in estimation theory are complementary: the engineering approaches are often naturally suited for temporal dynamics, are concerned with continuous-valued states, and exploit linearity for tractability; meanwhile, the<br />computer science approaches are often focused on logical rather than temporal dependencies, capture discrete-valued phenomena, and exploit graph sparsity for tractability.<br /><br />In this talk, we will put forth the viewpoint that new understandings of and methods for estimation are needed, that marry together the engineering and computer science perspectives.  As motivation, we will identify estimation problems that arise in strategic management of modern dynamical networks.

Randomized schemes are an attractive solution due to their limited communication overhead and simplicity, while their performance in terms of connection delay and duration can be evaluated using probability theory.<br /><br />In this talk, we first make the case for an additional performance metric: the energy efficiency of a duty cycling scheme. We show that operations to be performed when sensors switch between dormant and active states (e.g., opening/closing radio connections, warming up MEMS sensors) consume energy (and time). We also show that state-of-the-art randomized schemes do not address this issue. Then, we introduce a novel energy-efficient randomized scheme.

Although traditional cryptographic techniques can potentially prevent identity-based attacks, they are either unavailable or insufficient in certain scenarios. For example, bootstrapping secure association between communication parties requires user identification but it cannot be solved solely by cryptographic mechanisms because of the lack of a pre-shared secret. In emerging wireless networks, such as cognitive radio networks, the primary users shall be identified at the signal level without relying on higher-layer cryptographic means. Furthermore, cryptography is usually considered expensive for resource constrained devices, such as sensors and RFIDs. In light of these circumstances, there is an increasing interest in enhancing or supplementing traditional authentication protocols in wireless networks with various lower/physical layer fingerprint/signature schemes.<br />This talk provides an overview of various non-cryptographic mechanisms for user authentication and device identification in wireless networks.

The majority of these applications,<br />however, are extremely energy constrained, require real-time<br />guarantees, and increasingly often both.

Therefore, in these networks, message delivery relies on opportunistic routing where nodes use store-carry-and-forward paradigm to route the messages. However, effective forwarding based on a limited knowledge of contact behavior of nodes is challenging. In this talk, we will mainly discuss the routing problem in DTNs from several aspects and present four novel algorithms for different DTN environments: (i) multi-period multi-copy based Spray and Wait routing algorithm where the copies are distributed to the nodes in different periods, (i) multi-period erasure coding based routing algorithm where the optimal erasure coding parameters for different periods are selected to minimize the cost, (iii) efficient single copy based routing algorithm where the correlation between the mobility of nodes are utilized, and (iv) social structure-aware routing algorithm where message exchanges between nodes are performed considering the grouping behavior of nodes. In all of these algorithms, our common objective is to increase the message delivery ratio and decrease the average delivery delay while minimizing the routing cost (number of copies used per message or number of forwardings of a single message between the nodes) under given circumstances. We will also present simulation (based on both real and synthetic DTN traces) results regarding the performance comparison of the proposed algorithms with the state-of-the-art routing algorithms in DTNs.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Eyuphan Bulut received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

The quest for building a computer system that can do open-domain Question Answering is ultimately driven by a broader vision that sees computers operating more effectively in human terms rather than strictly computer terms. They should function in ways that understand complex information requirements, as people would express them, for example, in natural language questions or interactive dialogs.

This is a critical task, especially when MSs move randomly, as interactions with sensor nodes are unpredictable, typically of short duration, and affected by message losses. In addition, multiple MSs can be simultaneously present in the sensor contact area making the minimum energy data delivery a complex optimization problem. To solve the above issues, we propose a novel protocol that combines efficiently erasure coding with an ARQ scheme. The key features of the proposed protocol are: (i) the use of redundancy to cope efficiently with message losses in the multiple mobile sink environment, and (ii) the ability of adapting the level of redundancy based on feedbacks sent back by MSs through ACKs. We observed by simulation that our protocol outperforms an alternative protocol that relies only on an ARQ scheme, even when there is a single MS. We also validated our simulation results through a set of experimental measurements based on real sensor nodes. Our results show that the<br />adoption of encoding techniques increases the lifetime of the sensor in the range [40% - 55%] compared to simple ARQ approaches when applied to WSNs with MSs.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Giuseppe Anastasi is an associate professor of Computer Engineering at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Pisa, Italy.

Although several <br />intrusion detection schemes have been proposed in the literature, important problematic issues such as colluding <br />of malicious nodes are not taken care of. Another main issue that concerns MANET is that the mobile devices are <br />battery-powered and have limited computational resources. Hence, whatever may be the security mechanism that <br />is being deployed in the MANET, it is also necessary to ensure that it does not consume too much of the battery <br />power and the computational resource of the mobile nodes. In this talk, first some secure addressing schemes will <br />be discussed. Next two intrusion detection techniques for MANET will be presented that uses collaborative techniques.<br />The detection system takes care of colluding malicious nodes.

Examples include networked manufacturing systems, wireless sensor networks, networked feedback control systems, and the internet. Sociobiological groups such as flocks, swarms, and herds have built-in mechanisms for cooperative control wherein each individual is influenced only by its nearest neighbors, yet the group achieves consensus behaviors such as heading alignment, leader following, exploration of the environment, and evasion of predators.  It is known that groups of fireflies and of crickets align their frequencies, neurons in the brain fall into patterns of interacting burst phenomena, and biological groups fall into the circadian rhythm.  It was shown by Charles Darwin that local interactions <br />between population groups over long time scales lead to global results such as the evolution of species.<br /><br />This talk will review ideas of cooperative control for networked interacting teams.  Included are local voting protocols, second order consensus, synchronization of distributed interacting oscillators.  Local protocols based only on interactions between neighbors lead to global optimal behavior of distributed teams.  Results from graph theory show the importance of the communication structure on the agreement reached by the networked team.  Results from Lyapunov theory show the convergence to consensus values for nonlinear interaction protocols.  <br /><br />Consensus performance generally depends on the communication graph structure and cannot be independently controlled. This can pose severe limitations on the performance of distributed systems, including slow speeds of consensus and convergence to uncontrollable values. Some protocols are described which allow a team to reach consensus agreement that is independent of the communication graph structure, and can be effectively controlled by team leaders or cooperative decision makers.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Prof. Frank L.

However, current attestation either focuses on static system properties, e.g., code integrity, or requires hardware support such as Trusted Platform Module (TPM). There are attacks exploiting vulnerabilities that do not violate static system properties, and sensor platforms may not have hardware-based security support. This paper presents a software attestation scheme for dynamic data integrity based on data boundary integrity. It automatically transforms the source code and inserts data guards to track run- time program data. A data guard is unrecoverable once it is corrupted by an attacker, even if the attacker fully controls the system later. The corruption of any data guard at run time can be remotely detected. A corruption either indicates a software attack or a bug in the software that needs immediate attention. The benefits of the proposed attestation scheme are as follows. First, it does not rely on any additional hardware support, making it suitable for low-cost sensor nodes. Second, it introduces minimal communication cost and has adjustable run time memory overhead. Third, it works even if sensor nodes use different hardware platforms, as long as they run the same software. The prototype implementation and the experiments on TelosB motes show that the proposed technique is both effective and efficient for sensor networks.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Donggang Liu is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA).

A typical dynamic scene includes multiple<br />independently moving objects, which are being captured by a moving camera. Segmenting these unknown number of moving objects is a vital step towards interpretation of a dynamic scene.<br /><br />The segmentation problem can be seen as model-based clustering with an unknown number of clusters. For model-based clustering, to assign a data point to an appropriate cluster, the number of clusters and the corresponding cluster parameters should be known. On the other hand, the cluster parameters can be computed only if the cluster assignments are known. This &quot;chicken-and-egg&quot; dilemma leads to an iterative formulation for model-based clustering.<br /><br />Clustering aims to optimize a cost to achieve an optimal solution. If the number of clusters is increased, generally, the cost for the same data reduces. Thus for meaningful clustering, the clustering cost must be penalized for additional clusters. A variety of model selection methods<br />exist which incorporate this idea. To apply model selection to clustering, candidate models are generated sequentially by varying the number of clusters and the best model according to a model selection criterion is selected.<br /><br />For the image data encountered in computer vision applications, the iterative and sequential problem of model selection can be simplified to a one step optimization by using the knowledge that the clusters formed in an image are spatially coherent. The candidates for cluster parameters can be<br />generated by sampling spatially coherent image data points. Once the candidates are known, a subset of these candidates can be selected by optimizing a model selection criterion. This transforms the problem into a one step model selection problem which is solved by a novel branch-and-bound process. The proposed approach efficiently searches the solution space and guaranties optimality over the current set of hypotheses.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Ninad Thakoor received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2004 and 2009, respectively, under the supervision of Dr. Jean Gao.

Moving to multimedia documents increases further the difficulty of the task. A counter-argument is that by combining multiple modalities we might be able to increase the performance of single-modality methods. This is what we examined in the context of the EC-funded R&amp;D project BOEMIE (http://www.boemie.org). More specifically, in BOEMIE we examined the use of evolving multimedia ontologies in a synergistic approach that combines multimedia extraction and ontology evolution in a bootstrapping process. This involves the continuous extraction of semantic information from multimedia content in order to populate and enrich the ontologies, and the deployment of these ontologies to enhance the performance of the extraction system. The presentation discusses the project achievements, the open problems and the potential of the proposed approach.<br /><br />Title 2: Exhibiting affect and adaptivity in human robot interaction: an affective robot guide to Museums<br /><br />Abstract 2:<br />The basic goal of human robot interaction is to establish an effective communication between the two parties. In particular, robot emotion, speech, and facial expressions determine the way humans regard the robot, and they are deemed as essential for a natural form of communication. Addressing those issues is the focal point of this presentation, while as a test-bed we deployed a robot platform in a museum, where it serves as a guide to visitors. This work is performed in the context of the INDIGO R&amp;D project (http://www.ics.forth.gr/indigo/). INDIGO pursued the development of human-robot communication technology for intelligent mobile robots that operate in populated environments. The project addressed this issue from two sides: by enabling robots to correctly perceive and understand natural human behavior and by making them act in ways that are familiar to humans. The results of INDIGO were demonstrated in a museum guide use-case.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Vangelis Karkaletsis has substantial experience in the field of Language and Knowledge Engineering, applied to content analysis, data fusion from multimedia content, ontology engineering, multilingual generation, personalization.

The topic has been of interest in the speech research community due to the potential of increased robustness to acoustic noise that the visual modality holds. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain that have hindered practical applications of the technology - most notably difficulties with visual speech information extraction and audio-visual fusion algorithms that remain robust to the audio-visual environment variability inherent in practical, unconstrained interaction scenarios and audio-visual data sources, for example multi-party interaction in smart spaces, broadcast news, etc. These challenges are also shared across a number of interesting audio-visual speech technologies beyond the core speech recognition problem, where the visual modality has the potential to resolve ambiguity inherent in the audio signal alone; for example, speech enhancement, speech activity detection, speaker recognition, and others.<br /><br />Title 2: Far-Field Multimodal Speech Processing and Conversational Interaction in Smart Spaces<br /><br />Abstract 2:<br />Robust speech processing constitutes a crucial component in the development of usable and natural conversational interfaces. In this paper we are particularly interested in human-computer interaction taking place in &quot;smart&quot; spaces - equipped with a number of far-field, unobtrusive microphones and camera sensors. Their availability allows multi-sensory and multi-modal processing, thus improving robustness of speech-based perception technologies in a number of scenarios of interest, for example lectures and meetings held inside smart conference rooms, or interaction with domotic devices in smart homes. In this talk, we overview related work in developing state-of-the-art speech technology in smart spaces. In particular we discuss acoustic scene analysis, speech activity detection, speaker diarization, and speech recognition, emphasizing multi-sensory or multi-modal processing. The resulting technology is envisaged to allow far-field conversational interaction in smart spaces based on dialog management and natural language understanding of user requests.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Gerasimos Potamianos received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland in 1994.

On the other hand, as the processing technology pushes towards nano-scale, silicon reliability becomes one of the most important challenges in the design and fabrication of future microprocessors. The failure mechanisms could significantly degrade chip reliability and lifetime, and result in large economic losses. It is imperative to build a reliable processor while achieving an optimal trade-off among performance, reliability and power. In this talk, I will introduce several emerging failure mechanisms (e.g. soft error, negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), and process variation) and present three processor vulnerability-mitigation methodologies. The first methodology characterizes and mitigates the processor microarchitecture soft-error vulnerability in the presence of process variation. I will describe two techniques working at fine and coarse grain levels to efficiently improve the processor soft-error robustness. The second methodology observes the positive interplay between two failure mechanisms (NBTI and process variation) and intelligently leverages this interaction to tolerate their detrimental impact on reliability. The third methodology presented in this talk targets on hierarchically mitigating the NBTI and process variation effects on network-on-chip, a crucial hardware component in future many/multi-core processors.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Fu is a Computing Innovation Fellow (supported by the Computing Community Consortium and the Computing Research Association, with funding from the National Science Foundation) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In all of these fields, vision sensors are of great interest: cameras are less expensive than lasers and sonars, and can provide richer and non-contact measurements of the surroundings. However, vision is still not used as the main (or alone) on-board sensor, but jointly with others (e.g., inertial measurement units, lasers, etc.) which often requires performing initial, off-line and time-consumin multi-sensor calibration procedures.<br /><br />In this talk I will present my research in the field of autonomous navigation for a mobile robot equipped solely with an on-board camera (pinhole or omnidirectional). I will present a control strategy that uses multiple-view geometry features for the real-time control of the robot towards a goal configuration (specified exclusively by a target image). Our approach is able to avoid typical problems such as local minima or Jacobian singularities, typically encountered in standard image-based visual servoing control schemes. Another key advantage is that our strategy does not need any metrical knowledge of the 3-D observed scene. Moreover, and differently from state-of-the-art 2-1/2-D techniques, our algorithm does not need to estimate the relative pose between successive views (e.g., via homography matrix decomposition). This process, that would in fact require manual intervention, could also increase the sensitivity to image noise. Asymptotic convergence to the desired robot configuration has been proved, also in the case of unknown focal length. I will present experimental results together with recent extension of this work to the case of navigating in large outdoor environments.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Gian Luca Mariottini received his Master Degree summa cum laude in Computer Science and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Siena, Siena, Italy.

We will propose a Discrete-Cosine-Transform (DCT)-based approach for sense-through-foliage target detection using a single UWB radar when the echo signal quality is good, and a Radar Sensor Network (RSN) and DCT-based approach when the echo signal quality is poor. A RAKE structure which can combine the echos from different cluster-members will be proposed for cluster head in the RSN. We will compare our approach with the ideal case when both echos are available, i.e., echos with target and without target. We will also compare our approach against the scheme in which 2-D image is created via adding voltages with the appropriate time offset as well as the matched filter-based approach. We observe that the matched filter-based could not work well because the UWB channel has memory. We will apply two approaches to the sense-through-foliage channel modeling: Saleh and Valenzuela (S-V) method for UWB channel modeling and CLEAN method for narrowband and UWB channel modeling. Finally, we will demonstrate that for large-scale fading using path-loss and log-normal shadowing model for foliage environment, the path-loss exponent is very high due to rich scattering.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Qilian Liang is an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington.

Whereas not inefficient on shorter sequences, the current implementations of PWM matching are too expensive for whole-genome searches, which is now a performance bottleneck in today&#039;s genomics.<br /><br />After an introduction to PWMs and their applications, in this talk we shall present an algorithm we have developed for their efficient matching in long target sequences.

Thus, much beyond application of ever more sophisticated analysis techniques to understand data, systems biology begins to offer a uniquely powerful global model-based strategy to understand overwhelmingly unintuitive aspects of biological phenomena that are rooted in the inescapable facts of the nonlinearity and stochasticity of many complex biological systems. In this talk, I will show how using a mathematically grounded computational approach anchored in experimental data a hybrid approach- leads to otherwise unattainable insight into detailed signaling regulation, at multiple resolution scales. I will show examples from detailed G protein signaling regulation, from the subtle intricacies of signaling pathway interactions in mammalian cells, from the signaling underlying cancer onset and maintenance and from stochastic regulation of gene expression in bacteria underlying the phenomenon of competence. I will discuss this last topic more describing a new ongoing project that relies on a math-based computational approach, to recapitulate evolutionary choices in archetypical gene regulation network topologies. I will discuss how this is expected to feedback into the laboratory.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Turcotte holds a PhD in physics from McGill University.

His focus has been modeling, simulation and analysis of cell signaling processes in mammalian cells and reconstituted systems, and stochastic gene regulation in bacteria. His approach is based on the use of applied mathematics blended with computer science, in a hybrid computational/simulation and experimental strategy, to advance the understanding of key biological processes, primarily in signaling and regulation. These processes are governed by nonlinear dynamics and are too un-intuitive to understand without the guidance of a theoretical framework. In addition to cell signaling, Dr. Turcotte&#039;s focus includes using computational simulations of the nonlinear dynamics of excitable stochastic gene regulation circuits to investigate the role of stochastics in evolutionary selection. This is the focus of his recently funded NSF project. Dr. Turcotte&#039;s blend of theory and computations to guide experimentation is typical of the new breed of system biologists formed in quantitative and analytic sciences who increasing rely on theory supported by massive computations, to not only provide new answers, but to suggest new questions and thus increasingly shift the focus in biology from determining the &quot;how&quot; to determining the &quot;why&quot;.</p></div></div><div style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #CCC;"><p><strong>Providing Voice Connectivity using WiMAX from the Perspective of Emerging Markets: Issues and Solutions</strong><br /> Friday, October 30, 2009<br /> Mayank Raj<br /><i></i><br /><p><a href="#" id="137-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide(137);return false;">Read More</a></p></p><div id="137" class="more"><p><a href="#" id="137-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide(137);return false;">Hide</a></p><p><b>Abstract: </b>Connectivity is vital for socio-economic growth of any country, particularly for developing nations.

To save energy, the sensors operate according to sleep/awake schedules in an asynchronous manner. In this setting, we propose a novel semi-distributed, actor-centric localization algorithm which organizes the sensors in the vicinity of each actor by means of a discrete polar coordinate system. Specifically, each sensor is localized when it acquires the corona and sector coordinates of the region it resides in. To accomplish the localization task, each actor first trains a subset of sensors in its vicinity, which in turn train their neighbors. By modeling the deployed sensors as a two-dimensional Poisson point process and applying well-known results from the Coupon Collector&#039;s problem and Chernoff bounds, we derive bounds on the sensor density required to localize with high probability all sensors in the actor&#039;s vicinity.

One advantage of P2P networks is its resilience in terms of data replication, routing <br />recovery, and static resilience related to the detection of failures.  This advantage calls for an issue of peer-to-peer <br />applications: how to store data in the efficient location and retrieve data within expected time.<br /><br />The Resource Location and Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol has been developed in order to efficiently store and <br />retrieve data in the overlay.

Each Chord node maintains information about O(log N) other nodes and allows <br />nodes to route O(log N) messages to other nodes for efficient lookup.  Experimental results show that Chord is scalable and <br />achieves good performance with up-to-date information, but the performance degrades with out-of-date information.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Ms. Hyun Jung (Stella) Choe is a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Dr. Sajal K.

To address this challenge, we have deployed a first-of-its-kind, urban-scale wireless mesh network which provides Internet access to 1000&#039;s of users spanning multiple square kilometers in an underserved area in Houston, TX. However, in this and other urban environments, IEEE 802.11 node interactions are affected by a vast array of factors including topology, channel conditions, modulation rate, packet sizes, and physical layer capture.  In this talk, I overview findings across many different scales from 100&#039;s of thousands of urban measurements and the development of an analytical model to understand the performance of embedded links in the aforementioned complex scenario. Then, I focus on a fundamental concept involving embedded links. Namely, choosing the modulation rate which maximizes the throughput is imperative since each bit of the (overly-) shared medium is critical. Yet, all existing rate adaptation mechanisms fail to track the ideal rate even in a simple, non-mobile urban scenario.  Using a custom cross-layer framework, I implement multiple and previously un-implemented rate adaptation mechanisms to reveal the reasons for the failure and design modulation rate adaptation mechanisms which are able to track urban and downtown vehicular and non-mobile environments.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Joseph Camp is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rice University.

Consequently, software is increasingly prone to bugs and security exploits. In order to detect these bugs, programmers need tools that continuously monitor program runtime behavior.

WMNs are typically configured to<br />operate on a single channel using a single radio. The single channel<br />configuration adversely affects the capacity of the mesh due to the<br />interference from adjacent nodes in the network because all nodes compete<br />on the same channel. Equipping each node with multiple Network Interface<br />Cards (NICs) is emerging as a promising approach to improving the capacity<br />of WMNs. The IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standards allow multiple non-overlapping<br />frequency channels to be used simultaneously. Presence of multiple channels<br />requires to addressing the problem of which channel to use for a particular<br />transmission. The routing strategy in the network determines the load on each<br />802.11 interface, and in turn affects the bandwidth requirement and thus the<br />channel assignment of each interface. The joint channel assignment and routing<br />problem is NP-complete based on its mapping to a graph-colouring problem.<br />The presentation will illustrate how to manage the limited number of channels<br />and NICs and it will propose a Partitioned mesh network load and interference<br />aware channel assignment and routing (PaMeLA) algorithm.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Ms. Vanessa Gardellin is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science<br />Engineering, University of Pisa.

In this talk, we identify a number of vulnerabilities inherent in online communities and study opportunities for malicious participants to exploit the tight social fabric of these networks. With these problems in mind, we propose the SocialTrust framework for tamper-resilient trust establishment in online communities.

We present a boosting algorithm for schema matching with a unique ensembler feature, namely the ability to choose the matchers<br />that participate in an ensemble. SMB introduces a new promise for schema matcher designers. Instead of trying to design a perfect schema matcher that is accurate for all schema pairs, a designer can focus on finding better than random schema matchers.

In our experiments we have compared SMB with more than 30 other matchers over a real world data of 230 schemata and several<br />ensembling approaches, including the Meta-Learner of LSD.

Among these, realistic animations of fluids, rigid or flexible objects, or fractures cannot be obtained by artists at an affordable cost, or by engineering/scientific simulations that are not directly applicable to versatile animation problems. Therefore, computer graphics community has performed massive researches on simulation-based computer animation. Recent advances in such researches have led to a significant increase in realism and have benefited the digital entertainment industry. We will discuss two such methods for improving the realism in fluid simulations: (1) The improved BFECC advection that increases the dynamic in simulated fluid motion and (2) a volume control technique that prevent the loss of fluid volume.  The BFECC (Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction) was recently developed for interface computation using a level set method. We show that BFECC can be applied to reduce dissipation and diffusion encountered in a variety of advection steps, such as level set, velocity, smoke density, image, and dye advections on uniform and adaptive grids and on a triangulated surface.<br />BFECC provides second-order accuracy in both space and time. Liquid or gas simulated by the level set method can suffer from a slow but steady volume error that accumulates to a visible amount of volume change.  We propose to address this problem by using the volume control method. We trace the volume change of each connected region, and apply a carefully computed divergence that compensates undesired volume changes. To compute the divergence, we construct a mathematical model of the volume change, choose control strategies that egulate the modeled volume error, and establish methods to compute the control gains that provide robust and fast reduction of the volume error, and (if desired) the control of how the volume changes over time.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. ByungMoon Kim received a Ph.

All the different aspects of the BehaviorScope system, ranging from the low power platform and sensing architectures up to the interpretation mechanisms and abstractions used, will be presented and demonstrated. The main idea behind the proposed system is that human behaviors can be decomposed into sequences of very primitive actions that take place over space and time. Different activities can be described by simply combining these primitive actions over time in different ways. A multimodal wireless sensor network monitoring humans over space and time provides a stream of basic sensing features, called phonemes. This set of phonemes becomes the human activity alphabet. By hierarchically parsing the network-detected phonemes over time into primitive actions and then into simple activities and macroscale behaviors, we manage to do in the human activity domain the analogous of natural language processing, where letters are combined to form words, words are combined to form sentences, stories and so on.

They are characterized by their application-specific nature and tight constraints. Driven by ever increasing application demands and technological advances that allow us to put complete multi-processor systems on a chip (MPSoCs), system complexities are growing exponentially. This makes the process of designing embedded systems a tremendous challenge and traditional design methods infeasible.<br />In this talk, I will present an approach for automation of the design process at the electronic system level (ESL). The key to any automated design flow are well-defined abstraction levels, models and transformation steps in between. We have developed such concepts and techniques for modeling both system computation and communication at various levels of abstraction and across hardware and software boundaries. In a complete modeling flow, all models can be automatically generated from an abstract input specification. Models support validation through simulation and analysis with generally high accuracy and little overhead. Furthermore, models have been defined such that they can be automatically synthesized into the final system hardware and software. Tools based on this work have been integrated under a common GUI in the System-On-Chip Environment (SCE), and we have applied SCE to a wide variety of industrial-size design examples.

The significant power constraints and real-time guarantee requirements of these applications have become significant obstacles for the traditional embedded system design methodologies. The general-purpose computing microarchitectures of these platforms are designed to achieve good performance on average, which is far from optimal for any particular application. The system must always assume worst-case scenarios, which results in significant power inefficiencies and resource under-utilization.<br /><br />In my current research, we introduce a cross-layer application-customizable embedded platform, which dynamically exploits application information and fine-tunes system components at system software and hardware layers. This is achieved with the close cooperation and seamless integration of the compiler, the operation system, and the hardware architecture. The compiler is responsible for extracting application regularities through static and profile-based analysis. The relevant application knowledge is propagated and utilized at run-time across the system layers through the judiciously introduced reconfigurability at both OS and hardware layers. The introduced framework comprehensively covers the fundamental subsystems of memory management and multi-tasking execution control.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Xiangrong Zhou is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park.

On the other hand, if used to detect errors in programs, monitoring can bring more rigor to testing, because monitors can observe not only functional behaviors of programs at specific points, but also temporal behaviors that can refer to complex patters and histories of actions.<br />In this talk, I will discuss a generic and efficient monitoring framework, called monitoring oriented programming (MOP), as well as the predictive runtime analysis, a technique that effectively and soundly predicts concurrency bugs during testing by improving the coverage of runtime monitoring using static information.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Mr. Feng Chen is a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

PROMISE, CoopNet, CoolStreaming, and PRIME are all examples of peer-to-peer media streaming systems.  Although peer-to-peer designs offer many benefits, such as reduced costs and scalability, they also offer new opportunities for misbehavior.  For example, a selfish peer might request more than its fair share of bandwidth, while a malicious peer might want to intentionally exhaust all of the available upload bandwidth in the system.  Due to the lack of a central server, misbehaving peers can distribute their requests throughout the system such that they appear well-behaved to each individual node, but their aggregate behavior would appear to be selfish or malicious overall.  Given this vulnerability, it becomes clear that such peer-to-peer systems need effective mechanisms to throttle the aggregate bandwidth consumed by each peer in the system.  Unlike client-server architectures where everything can be monitored at a central server, peer-to-peer architectures will need a more robust and scalable alternative.<br /><br />In this talk, I will argue that a subset of trusted peers can collectively limit the bandwidth usage of all the other untrusted peers in the system.  We refer to these trusted nodes as &quot;kantoku&quot; nodes.  Kantoku nodes collectively provide a service that accounts for the bandwidth usage of each peer in the system.   Using kantoku nodes, selfish and malicious peers attempting to exceed their fair share of bandwidth usage are throttled according to their level of abuse.  Preliminary results indicate that kantoku nodes can significantly improve the streaming quality received by well-behaved nodes when malicious attackers attempting to exhaust the available upload bandwidth in the system are present.<br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>William Conner is a Ph.D. student in the Multimedia Operating System and Networking (MONET) Research Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The following observations will be made from the system<br />simulation:<br /><br />1) Stochasticity in the transcription/translation machinery has no observable effects.<br /><br />2) The mRNA levels jump back to saturation after a longer time when blunt-ended siRNAs are used.<br /><br />3) Sustained gene silencing can be achieved only if there is a way to replenish dsRNAs in the cell.<br /><br />4) Initial findings show about 3.5 times more blunt-ended molecules will be required to keep down the mRNA levels. However, the length of the silenced period is longer for blunt-ended molecules.<br /><br />[This work was done while the speaker was a summer intern in the Pfizer-Groton Labs in Connecticut in Summer 2007.

These algorithms have recently received considerable attention as a means to sidetrack problems of partial observability and policy oscillation and even divergence encountered in value function-based reinforcement learning methods. This talk will present two Bayesian policy gradient algorithms. These algorithms use Gaussian processes to define prior distribution over the performance gradient, and obtain closed-form expressions for its posterior distribution, conditioned on the observed data. The posterior mean serves as the policy gradient estimate, and is used to update the policy, while the posterior covariance allows us to gauge the reliability of the update.  This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. In the first algorithm, the basic observable unit, upon<br />which learning and inference are based, is a complete trajectory, allowing the algorithm to handle non-Markovian systems. The second algorithm takes advantage of the Markov property of the system trajectories and uses individual state-action-reward transitions as its basic observable unit.

This framework is a novel learning approach with implications to important theoretical issues (e.g. language origin, conceptual grounding) and applications to several problems. The Human Activity Language (HAL) represents the sequential and parallel aspects of human movement with perceptual and generational properties. HAL consists of kinetology, morphology, and <br />syntax. Kinetology, the phonology of human movement, finds basic primitives for human motion (segmentation) and associates them with symbols (symbolization). We also introduce five principles on which kinetology should be based and evaluated. This way, kinetology provides a symbolic representation for human movement that allows synthesis, analysis, and symbolic manipulation. Kinetology also has applications in compression, decompression, and indexing of motion data. The morphology of a human action is related to the inference of essential parts of the movement (morpho-kinetology) and its structure (morpho-syntax). In order to learn the morphemes and their structure, we present a grammatical inference methodology and introduce a parallel learning algorithm to induce a grammar system representing a single action. In practice, the morphology is concerned with the construction of a praxicon, a lexicon of actions, to aid an artificial cognitive system or a computer animation system. The syntax of human activities involves the construction of motor sentences using action morphemes. A sentence may range from a single action morpheme (nuclear<br />syntax) to a sequence of sets of morphemes. A single morpheme is decomposed into analogs of lexical categories: nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Sets of morphemes represent simultaneous actions (parallel syntax) and a sequence of movements is related to the concatenation of activities (sequential syntax). Our approach is able to address several problems related to data-driven computer animation. Nuclear syntax, especially adverbs, is related to the motion interpolation problem, parallel syntax addresses the slicing problem, and sequential syntax is proposed as an alternative method to the transitioning problem. In computer vision, surveillance relies on automatic activity detection and recognition based on action representations. In Humanoid Robotics, adequate movement models are detailed domain knowledge for the solution of complex nonlinear dynamics problems related to motor coordination.

Data authentication constitutes a new dimension in data management and data structure design. At the same time, the problem captures the security needs of many computing applications that exchange and use sensitive information in hostile distributed environments and its importance increases given the trend in modern system design towards decentralized architectures with minimal trust assumptions. In this talk, we focus on the design of data structures and protocols that allow the secure and efficient authentication of dynamic data maintained by an untrusted entity (not the data creator), supporting the correctness verification of operations performed on the data. We first present a new technique for distributed data authentication, showing how data stored and retrieved over a peer-to-peer network can be efficiently validated. Based on the design of an efficient distributed authentication tree, our approach provides reliable distributed storage, secure against replay attacks and consistent with the update history. We also describe a new framework for authenticating general queries on structured data, satisfying important properties in terms of expressiveness and complexity. We discuss how this framework can be applied for the efficient verification of operations on a file system that is outsourced to an untrusted server and conclude with some interesting research directions.</p><p><b>Biography: </b>Nikos Triandopoulos is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College.

Retrieving similar patterns is a necessary component of many practical applications, in fields as diverse as computer vision, speech recognition, and bioinformatics. This talk presents BoostMap, a method for efficient similarity-based retrieval in spaces with computationally expensive distance measures. Our method constructs embeddings that map database and query patterns into a vector space with a computationally efficient distance measure. Using such a mapping, similar patterns can be retrieved efficiently - often orders of magnitude faster compared to retrieval using the original distance measure. In the BoostMap method, embedding construction is treated as a machine learning problem, and embedding quality is optimized using information from training data. A key property of the learning-based formulation is that the optimization criterion does not depend on geometric properties and is equally valid in both metric and non-metric spaces. In experiments with several datasets, our method compares favorably to alternative methods for efficient retrieval, and provides highly competitive results for applications such as handwritten character recognition and time series indexing.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Biography: </b>Dr. Athitsos received the BS degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1995, the MS degree in computer science from the University of Chicago in 1997, and the PhD degree in computer science from Boston University in 2006.

Since poor design choices  <br />can lead to grossly suboptimal policies, agents that automatically  <br />adapt their own representations have the potential to dramatically  <br />improve performance. This talk introduces two novel approaches for  <br />automatically discovering high-performing representations.  The first  <br />approach, called evolutionary function approximation, uses  <br />evolutionary methods to optimize representations for neural network  <br />function approximators.  Hence, it evolves agents that are better  <br />able to learn.  The second approach, called adaptive tile coding,  <br />begins with coarse representations and gradually refines them during  <br />learning, analyzing the current policy and value function to deduce  <br />the best refinements.

These interactions enable modeling and analysis of a cell from a systems perspective - generally using network models. In this talk, we focus on development of computational tools and statistical models for comparative analysis of molecular interaction networks. We first discuss the problem of identifying conserved sub-networks in a collection of interaction networks belonging to diverse species. The main algorithmic challenges here stem from the NP-hard subgraph isomorphism problem that underlies frequent subgraph discovery. Three decades of research into theoretical aspects of this problem has highlighted the futility of syntactic approaches, thus motivating use of semantic information. Using a biologically motivated homolog contraction technique for relating proteins across species, we render this problem tractable. We experimentally show that the proposed method can be used as a pruning heuristic that accelerates existing techniques significantly, as well as a standalone tool that conveys significant biological insights at near-interactive rates.  With a view to understanding the conservation and divergence of modular substructures, we also develop network alignment techniques, grounded in theoretical models of network evolution.  In order to assess the statistical significance of the patterns identified by our algorithms, we probabilistically analyze the distribution of highly connected and conserved subgraphs in random graphs. Our methods and algorithms are implemented on various platforms and tested extensively on a comprehensive collection of molecular interaction data, illustrating their effectiveness in terms of providing novel biological insights as well as computational efficiency.
